To\nshare a resource, you create a resource share, associate the resource with the\nresource share, and specify the principals that can access the resource. The\nfollowing principals are supported:\n\n *  The ID of an AWS account\n   \n   \n *  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an OU from AWS Organizations\n   \n   \n *  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization from AWS Organizations\n   \n   \n\nIf you specify an AWS account that doesn't exist in the same organization as the\naccount that owns the resource share, the owner of the specified account\nreceives an invitation to accept the resource share. After the owner accepts the\ninvitation, they can access the resources in the resource share. An\nadministrator of the specified account can use IAM policies to restrict access\nresources in the resource share.",
